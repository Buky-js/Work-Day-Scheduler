Below is how the application works:
 * When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
 * When you scroll down, you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
 * When you view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color-coded to indicate ehether it is in the past, present or future
 * When you click into a timeblock, you can enter an event
 * When you click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage
 * when you refresh the page, the saved events persist
